RemoteBuild
===========

RemoteBuild Sublime Text 2 plugin

Has been tested using plink to connect to a remote Unix build server to build Android.
Edit remotebuild.sublime-settings, review the settings, most of them will have to be
modified to match your build server, account, and proeject settings.

Also, whatever tool you use for connecting to the remote host (plink for example), you'll 
have to make sure is added to your PATH.
